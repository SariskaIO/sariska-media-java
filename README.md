Sariska Media provides powerful Java API's for developing real-time applications.

This is a sample app to showcase basic functionality of Sariska Media API's which can be leveraged for your Native Android development.

The sample app lets you create a room with a name of your choice. Once the user clicks on the start meeting button, a conference is created and any other user with the same room name can join in.
